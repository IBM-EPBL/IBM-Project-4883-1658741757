Efficient Water Quality Analysis &amp; Prediction using Machine Learning
Water is an essential resource for human existence.
In fact, more than 60% of the human body is made up of water. 
Our bodies consume water in every cell, in the different organisms and in the tissues.
Hence, water allows stabilization of the body temperature and guarantees the normal functioning of the other bodily activities. 
Nevertheless, in recent years, water pollution has become a serious problem affecting water quality. 
Therefore, to design a model that predicts water quality is nowadays very important to control water pollution, as well as to alert users in case of poor quality detection.
Motivated by these reasons, in this study, we take the advantages of machine learning algorithms to develop a model that is capable of predicting the water quality index and then the water quality class.
The method we propose is based on four water parameters: temperature, pH, turbidity and coliforms.
The use of the multiple regression algorithms has proven to be important and effective in predicting the water quality index.
0In addition, the adoption of the artificial neural network provides the most highly efficient way to classify the water quality.
